sort1 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Selection sort is the one of the algorithms which takes the longest time. This one took the longest one all 3 tests

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: It was extremely fast compared to the other sorts. It was the fastest on all 3 tests

sort3 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: Bubble is usually faster than selection sort.
But Bubble would probably take a little more time than selection sort on a already sorted list. So im a bit confused right now
