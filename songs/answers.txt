- You could look at the danceabilty, energy, loudness, speechiness, valence and tempo of each song and then use those numbers to calculate their Audio Aura.
So if the person listen to alot of songs with a high danceabilty the person would get the Audio Aura "Dancing monkey" or something like that.

- Alot of people listen to more than 100 different songs a year including myself.
