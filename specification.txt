Description:
I have used Javascript to make some content show up when you press a button.
Then the content can be hidden again if you press another button.
I have also used Javascript to make a quiz about myself. So the buttons would turn red or green based on the corret answer

I have actually used Bootstrap alot since i found out it was very useful.
Since you can basically use it for everything and them modify it to match 100% what you need.
So yeah i basically used it for my whole site. Not all of it tho, but most of it.
